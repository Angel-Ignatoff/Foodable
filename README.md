## Project Idea

### UN Sustainable development goal number: 2 and 3

### Motivation: We decided to do this because we believe this app would be useful since many people in need do not have easy access to food, and this webpage is going to allow the user to recieve food easier. Our web application will encourage people to donate food by providing vouchers and rewards based on the amount donated. Our idea is different as it allows people in need to find local foodbanks near them, and it also allows people in need to recieve packages of food tailored to their dietary needs such as Vegan, Halal, etc.

### Features:
Requirements – Functional

As a user, I need to create an account so that I can log on the website to donate Food
As a user, I need to have a system to ensure that the right food is going to the right people.
As a user, I need to have a way that foodbank can get in touch with us to allow them as one of our chains to provide Food as well to donate in person.
As a user, I need to create rewards for people who donate food through our website. 
As a user, I want the ability to donate Food as well as Money.

Requirements – Non-Functional

As a user, I want the site to have minimised downtime that ensures that the site can work to the best of its ability. 
As a user, I need to ensure that GDPR laws are taken in account of and allow the choice to stop tracking and keeping personal information of logs. 
As a user, I need to ensure that the security of each user account is validated through a medium like an email.
As a user, I need to use this website on any device that has an internet connection. 

Requirements – User Interface 

As a user, I need a simple and easy way to give my details as a customer to use this website.
As a user, I need to be able to easily navigate this website with little to no instructions
As a user, I need to be able to sign up easily and ensure I can make the right donation.
